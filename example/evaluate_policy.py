"""Example evaluation script to evaluate a policy.

This is an example evaluation script for evaluating a "RandomPolicy".  Use this
as a base for your own script to evaluate your policy.  All you need to do is
to replace the `RandomPolicy` and potentially the Gym environment with your own
ones (see the TODOs in the code below).

This script will be executed in an automated procedure.  For this to work, make
sure you do not change the overall structure of the script!

This script expects the following arguments in the given order:
 - Difficulty level (needed for reward computation)
 - initial pose of the cube (as JSON string)
 - goal pose of the cube (as JSON string)
 - file to which the action log is written

It is then expected to initialize the environment with the given initial pose
and execute exactly one episode with the policy that is to be evaluated.

When finished, the action log, which is created by the TriFingerPlatform class,
is written to the specified file.  This log file is crucial as it is used to
evaluate the actual performance of the policy.
