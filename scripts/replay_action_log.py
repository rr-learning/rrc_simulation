"""Replay actions for a given logfile and verify final object pose.

The log file is a JSON file as produced by
`rrc_simulation.TriFingerPlatform.store_action_log()` which contains the
initial state, a list of all applied actions and the final state of the object.

The simulation is initialised according to the given initial pose and the
actions are applied one by one.  In the end, it is verified if the final object
pose in the simulation matches the one in the log file.

The accumulated reward is computed based on the given goal pose and printed in
the end.

Both initial and goal pose are given as JSON strings with keys "position" and
"orientation" (as quaternion).  Example:

    {"position": [-0.03, 0.07, 0.05], "orientation": [0.0, 0.0, 0.68, -0.73]}
